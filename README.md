### Implementing ChatGPT from Scratch

This repository covers the implementation of a simplified version of ChatGPT ([NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) by [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/)). We implemented a decoder-based transformer (without cross-attention) and trained it on a tiny Shakespeare dataset. We explored the pretraining phase of ChatGPT. However, the details of the finetuning step (making it an assistant) are proprietary, so we only cover the pretraining steps in this tutorial.
